# PortofolioSite

This is a Portofolio that is the final project of a front-end internship. It was made entirely from scratch, but the theme was 100% inspired from https://trendytheme.net/demo/wp/iamx-intro/


The "Works" section of the website includes 3 of the mini-games made during the internship:
- "Guess the Number" game;
- "Find the Pairs" game;
- "Quiz" game.

All with a very basic UI in the same style.
